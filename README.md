# Eth-mnemonics-bruteforcing
Here a NodeJs script that generates random phrases for eth wallets, and from these the associated addresses .. 
after that check if there are funds inside each of them and if so, send an email to the specified address with the wallet data .. 
The Email address that sends the message in the code is from outlook / hotmail, but can be changed with any provider.

this code is only for study purposes, I take no responsibility for any illegitimate action resulting from its improper use.
